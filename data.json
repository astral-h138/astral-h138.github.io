It can be considered the mother of the world. I do not know its name; Its symbol is called Dao. If I tried to make its name, I would call it great. Being great speaks of departing. Departing speaks of being remote. Being remote speaks of returning. Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, The king is also great. Within the realm exist four that are great, And the king resides as one of them! People follow the earth. The earth follows heaven. Heaven follows Dao. Dao follows what is naturally so.", "Serious serves as the source of frivolous. Stillness serves as the ruler of restlessness.

This is called following your insight. Therefore : he who is a virtuous person is the teacher of he who is not a virtuous person. He who is not a virtuous person is the resource of he who is a virtuous person.

There are no citizens who would make this happen, Yet it would be naturally fair and impartial. And so, begin to divide and you have names.

If the ten thousand creatures could not use their life, I fear they would be destroyed. If nobles and kings could not use their high rank and prominence, I fear they would fall.
